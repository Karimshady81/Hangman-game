Built a fully functional Hangman word-guessing game using React
Used useState to manage game state including guessed letters, remaining attempts, and win/loss conditions.
Designed a responsive UI with interactive buttons and dynamic game feedback.
Developed logic to reveal letters in the target word based on user guesses.
Disabled used letters and tracked incorrect attempts to ensure smooth gameplay.
Practiced conditionally rendering UI elements and organizing the app into small reusable components.
